            <td> One of crucial issues for Reduction of Traffic Congestion of Ambulances(RTCA) is to reduce response time. However,
    in metropolis city, a traffic congestion is an obstacle for an ambulance to responsively reach at the scene,
    then patient mortality and disability rates increase. Traffic congestion is considered as a complex spatial–
    temporal situation. It is often triggered by repeating factors, such as car lane capacity, weather, and
    unexpected events. Therefore, a real-time traffic condition is required to effectively determine the location
    of an ambulance. The current ambulance base allocation strategy model considers only demand point,
    resulting inability to handle high traffic congestion. This webite proposed a covering model based on traffic
    congestion (using Google map API) to allocate ambulance bases that covering all demand point, while
    minimizing the number of the ambulance. In addition, our model was applied to the case study of Bangkok
    EMSOne of crucial issues for emergency medical
    service (EMS) in metropolis city is traffic congestion.
    Especially, the ambulance services are highly affected.
    Their response time increases leading to the causes of
    death and disabilities of patients in crisis, which impose
    severe socio-economic costs across the world. [1]. The
    main objective of emergency ambulance service is to
    reach the scene within the effective target time for
    treatment. Typically, EMS responds to 90% of
    emergency calls within 8 min [2].
    For example, the traffic condition for Bangkok is
    considered as the second-most congested city in the
    world, it has 61% congestion level (overall travel time
    when compared uncongested), which is 64 minutes of
    extra travel time (TomTom Traffic 2016). Extra travel
    time of traffic congestion affect to ambulance and
    survival rate of patients in the scene [3], therefore
    allocation strategy of ambulance has been affected by
    this traffic congestion. However, it is impossible to place
    an ambulance all possible bases. EMS managers and
    administrators have difficulties of locating a limited
    number of ambulances to cover all accidents or demands
    points..</td>

    <td> Results
        For results, we compare difference 3 periods, which
        difference traffic speed at each location. We collect
        traffic speed data from Google map API at 3 periods,
        such as daytime in weekend (assume all location traffic
        speed 80 Km/h), peck hour in normally day and daytime
        in normally day to analyze traffic condition of each
        locations. Afterthought, we send data to the traffic system controllers to set that particular 
        way free.</td>
    <td>A Case Study in Bangkok
        Bangkok is the capital and the most populous city in
        Thailand. Bangkok has a population of more than 14
        million. Traffic congestion is major problem in Thailand,
        which has a tremendous impact on the economy and
        public health. In 2016 The INRIX Global Traffic
        Scorecard rated Bangkok the 12th most congested of all
        cities rated (1st most congested of Asia), considerably
        worse than 30th in 2015, with a traffic scorecard rating
        of 11, down from 20 in 2015 (INRIX 2017). Bangkok
        drivers spent an average 64.1 hours a year in traffic jams,
        according to the scorecard 23% of overall time and an
        average 33% of their time during peak hours. Moreover,
        For historical traffic status in Bangkok area (google
        map 2017), it shows in Figure 3. We divided the area
        into 56 locations (6 kilometers by 6 kilometers) include
        44 full of area and 12 some part of area and have 3 levels
        of traffic speed; (i) green area, average traffic speed
        more than 50 km/h, (ii) orange area, average traffic
        speed lower than 50 km/h and more than 30 km/h, and
        finally (iii) rad area, average traffic speed lower than 30
        km/h. that indicated most area in Bangkok have traffic
        speed lower than 50 km/h. At 8 minutes of response
        time, ambulance must travel to the scene by traffic speed
        75 kilometers per hour.</td>
    <td>2 Mathematical model with traffic condition
        We allocate both number of ambulances and base
       locations by using the covering model. In this study, we
       consider traffic congestion information into the model by
       adding a constraint to balance between average car speed
       and acceptable speed in a location. We named the
       proposed model as “Traffic Speed of Location Set
       Covering Problem for Traffic Speed” (LSCP-TS). Our
       model was under the following assumptions: traffic
       speed are deterministic, the base locations must be
       availab</td>

<h3>comunicatioin with traffics</h3>
<p>
    when an ambulnce reach the destination of the patient 
    it communicate with the hospital and the hospital will 
    alert the traffic system controllers .then they the check 
    the route of which the ambulance can pass through
    and they communicate with traffic officers to release
    the cars that were from the same route as the ambulance
    so that it may give a way to the hospital in that way 
    it will save the patient

    <h3>traffic control</h3>
    <p>
        The proposed framework of integrated traffic
information for allocating ambulance bases is shown in
Figure 1. First of all, we collected a traffic information
database from Google map by using Google map API,
that publish traffic information to study in this area
temporal terms from the collected data in assigned area.
In assigned area, there are more than one road and each
line has a different road length, thus this study use
average speed of car on this area to identity traffic
condition. After got information, We compute the traffic
speed on each area for allocate ambulance base by using
the ratio of Traffic speed of road and a number of road in
the area

    <h3>fast emagency</h3>
    <p>
        Ambulances sometimes cannot get to emergencies fast enough. Often, the 
        reason first responders cannot get patients to a hospital in time is because
         of traffic jams. In 2017, 20% of emergency patients’ deaths were caused by 
         traffic jams.(The Nation, 2017) Another reason is ambulance crashes. From 1990 to 2009, there was 
         a total of 84,810 ambulance crashes. Out of these, 121 were fatal. 51 of these crashes involved
          ambulances currently in emergency use.(Casey C. Grant, P.E., and Brian Merrifield, 2011) A third 
          reason is the time it takes to getto the hospital after the patient has been picked up from the
           site of the emergency
